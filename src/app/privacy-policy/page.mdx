HitUp Tennis Privacy Policy
Effective Date: July 30, 2025 At HitUp Tennis, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and secure your information when you use the HitUp Tennis mobile application (the "App"). It also describes your rights regarding your personal data. This App is intended for users 18 years of age or older. By using HitUp Tennis, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
Information We Collect
We collect personal information from you when you register an account, use our services, or communicate with us. The types of personal data we collect include:
Contact Information: Your name, phone number, email address, and mailing address (for account setup and profile details).
Tennis Match Data: Information related to your use of the Appâ€™s features, such as match results, scores, and statistics you enter, as well as match scheduling details (dates, times, and locations of matches you plan or participate in).
How we collect data: Most information is provided directly by you. For example, you enter contact details when creating an account and provide match information when scheduling a game or reporting results. We do not collect personal data from third-party sources. (We may collect some non-personal technical data automatically, such as device type or OS version, purely to ensure the App functions properly, but this data is not used to identify you.)
How We Use Your Information
We use your personal data to operate and improve the App, provide our services to you, and support your tennis activities. This includes:
Providing and Improving Services: Using your information to create and manage your user account, schedule matches with other players, record and display match results, and improve App functionality and user experience.
Communication: Using your phone number or email to send you service-related communications. For example, we may send match confirmations, reminders, updates on schedule changes, or respond to your support inquiries.
Personalization: If applicable, using your provided address or location to help you find nearby players or tennis events, and tailoring certain features to your region.
Safety and Integrity: Using data (such as match history) to monitor for fraudulent or abusive behavior, enforce our Terms of Service, and ensure the integrity of competitions.
Legal Obligations: Retaining and using personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for instance, verifying user age or responding to lawful requests by authorities).
We will only use your personal data for the purposes described above. If we need to use your information for any other purpose, we will seek your consent in advance or update this Privacy Policy accordingly.
Sharing and Disclosure of Information
We value your privacy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties for their own marketing or any other purposes. We also do not share your data with unrelated third parties, except in the limited circumstances described below:
Service Providers: We may share necessary personal data with trusted third-party service providers who perform functions on our behalf to operate the App. For example, this could include cloud hosting providers (to store data securely) or email/SMS services (to send match notifications or verification codes). These partners are contractually obligated to protect your information and only use it for our specified purposes.
Legal Compliance: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid legal process (such as a subpoena, court order, or government request). We may also share information if we believe, in good faith, that disclosure is necessary to investigate or protect against illegal activities, suspected fraud, or to enforce our terms and the rights, property, or safety of HitUp Tennis, our users, or others.
Business Transfers: If HitUp Tennis is involved in a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or reorganization, your personal data may be transferred to the succeeding entity. We will ensure any successor honors the commitments in this Privacy Policy, and we will notify you (for example, via email or a notice in the App) of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.
With Your Consent: Aside from the cases above, we will only share your information with third parties if you give us your explicit consent to do so. For instance, if we ever introduce a feature that involves an outside partner or optional data sharing, you will have the choice to opt-in.
Sharing with other users: Keep in mind that some information you provide through the App may be visible to other registered users by design. For example, when you schedule a match with another player, your name and the match details will be shared with that participant. Likewise, match results might be visible to your match partner or within a group if you are participating in a league or ladder. We urge you to only share information you are comfortable disclosing. (However, no personal contact details like your phone number, email, or address are publicly visible to other users through the App, unless you choose to share that information yourself.)
Data Storage and Security
We take the security of your personal data seriously. Your information is stored on secure servers and we employ industry-standard security measures to protect it. These measures include:
Encryption: We use encryption (e.g., HTTPS/TLS protocols) to protect data transmitted between your device and our servers. Sensitive information (such as your login credentials or personal details) is encrypted in transit, and we also employ encryption at rest for stored data where appropriate.
Access Controls: We limit access to personal data to authorized personnel who need it to operate or improve the App. All staff and contractors with such access are subject to strict confidentiality obligations.
Security Practices: We regularly update and patch our application and backend systems to address security vulnerabilities. We use firewalls and monitoring to guard against security breaches, and we periodically review our information collection and storage practices to ensure safety.
No Absolute Guarantee: Please note that while we strive to protect your information, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security of your data. You share and transmit information at your own risk. In the event of a data breach, we will notify affected users and take all required steps in accordance with applicable laws.
Data Retention
We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, or as required or permitted by law. In practice:
Account Duration: For as long as you maintain an active account with HitUp Tennis, we will keep the personal data you provided (such as your contact info and match data) so that we can provide the service to you.
Inactive Accounts: If you stop using the App or your account becomes inactive, we may retain your information for a reasonable period in case you return, or as needed to maintain records of your tennis match history for your future reference. After that period, or upon your request, we will either delete or anonymize your personal data, except where we must keep it for legal reasons.
Account Deletion: If you request deletion of your data or close your account (see Your Rights below), we will remove or anonymize your personal information in our active databases. Some information may be retained in secure backups for a short period (e.g. in routine archival backups) and will be deleted according to our backup retention schedules. We may also retain certain information if necessary for legal compliance, to resolve disputes, or to enforce our agreements. In all such cases, we will retain the minimum amount of data necessary for the required purpose and for the minimum time required by law.
Your Rights and Choices
You have rights and choices regarding your personal data. We are committed to providing you with access and control. Subject to applicable laws, your rights include:
Access Your Information: You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you. We will provide this information, in a common digital format, upon request.
Correct Your Information: If any of your personal details (such as your name or contact info) are inaccurate or outdated, you have the right to correct or update them. You can typically do this by editing your profile in the App. If you need assistance with updates, you can contact us at the email below and we will help rectify any incorrect information.
Delete Your Data (Right to Erasure): You have the right to request deletion of your personal data. You may do this by using any provided account deletion feature in the App or by contacting us to request deletion. When we receive such a request, we will delete your personal data from our records (and instruct our service providers to do the same), except for information we are required to keep by law or for legitimate business purposes (as described in Data Retention above).
Account Termination: You can terminate your HitUp Tennis account at any time. This can usually be done through an in-app setting or by contacting us for assistance. When an account is terminated, we will deactivate it and remove or anonymize personal data associated with it as described in the Data Retention section. Keep in mind that removal from backups and caches may not be immediate but will occur as soon as feasible.
Opt-Out of Communications: If we send promotional emails or newsletters (if this becomes part of our service), you can opt out at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in those emails or adjusting your notification settings in the App. Note that you will still receive transactional messages about matches or your account (e.g., match reminders or account notices) as these are necessary for providing our service.
California Privacy Rights: If you are a California resident, you have specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). These include the right to know what categories of personal information we collect and why, the right to access the specific information we hold about you, the right to request deletion of your information, and the right to not be discriminated against for exercising these privacy rights. Importantly, we do not sell or share your personal information for monetary gain or for targeted advertising as defined under California law. Therefore, the CCPA right to opt out of sale is generally not applicable. If you have any questions or requests concerning your California privacy rights, please contact us using the information below.
Exercising Your Rights: To exercise any of your rights or make requests regarding your personal data, please contact us at our support email provided in the Contact Us section. For security, we may need to verify your identity (for example, by confirming information we already have on file) before fulfilling your request. We will respond to your request within the timeframe required by law (typically within 30-45 days). There is no charge for making a reasonable request, but repeated or excessive requests may incur a fee as permitted by law.
Children's Privacy (Age Requirement)
Our App and services are intended for users 18 years of age or older. We do not permit individuals under the age of 18 to create an account or use HitUp Tennis. Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 18 years old. If you are under 18, please do not attempt to register or send any personal information to us. In the event that we learn we have collected personal data from a user under 18, we will take immediate steps to delete such information from our records. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a minor under 18, please contact us so that we can investigate and address the issue promptly. (For parents or guardians: If you become aware that your child under 18 has provided personal information to our App, please contact us and we will delete it.)
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update or revise this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. If we make material changes, we will notify you by means of a notice within the App or by email (if we have your email on file) prior to the change becoming effective. We will also update the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy to indicate the date of the latest revision. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of HitUp Tennis after any update to this Policy will signify your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the revised terms, you should stop using the App and may request that we delete your data as described above.
