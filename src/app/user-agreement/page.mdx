Welcome to HitUp Tennis! These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a legal agreement between you (“you” or “User”) and the operator of the HitUp Tennis mobile application and related services (“HitUp Tennis,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By downloading, installing, or using the app, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the app.

Age Restriction: HitUp Tennis is offered only to individuals 18 years of age or older. By creating an account, you confirm you meet this requirement.

1 | Account Registration and Security
Accurate Information — You must provide truthful, current, and complete information when creating an account and keep it updated.

Single Account — Each individual may maintain only one account. Accounts are personal and non-transferable.

Credentials — You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity under your account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.

Suspension / Termination — We may suspend or terminate your account (with or without notice) if we believe you have violated these Terms, the law, or others’ rights.

2 | The Services
HitUp Tennis enables adult tennis players in the United States to:

Create and respond to match invitations ( “HitUps” );

Communicate with other players through in-app chat;

Track and view match scores and statistics;

Optionally purchase a Season Membership (see § 6) to unlock premium features.

We act solely as a neutral venue connecting players. We neither referees matches nor guarantee that any user will honor commitments.

3 | User Conduct
You agree to use the services only for lawful, respectful, tennis-related purposes. Prohibited behavior includes, but is not limited to:

Category	Examples (non-exhaustive)
Illegal content or activity	Fraud, gambling, harassment, threats, hate speech, or dissemination of malware.
Privacy violations	Posting someone else’s personal data without permission.
Abusive or obscene content	Pornographic, violent, or otherwise offensive material.
Spam & commercial solicitation	Unsolicited ads, mass-messaging, or multi-level marketing.
Interference & misuse	Reverse-engineering the app, using bots or scraping, or attempting to access another user’s account.

We may remove content, restrict features, or terminate accounts that violate these rules.

4 | Match Invitations & Chat
Accuracy — You must provide truthful details (time, location, skill level, etc.) when posting or accepting a HitUp.

Timeliness — If you cannot attend a scheduled match, notify other participants as early as possible.

Safety — Meet in public courts and take reasonable precautions. We are not liable for injuries, losses, or disputes arising from in-person play.

Private Messaging — Chat is intended for match coordination. Do not share sensitive data you would not want others to keep or forward. We generally do not monitor private messages but may review them to investigate abuse or comply with law.

5 | Season Membership (Paid Service)
Overview — Season Membership offers premium features (such as advanced matching or higher visibility). Details appear in-app and may change over time.

Payment Method — All purchases are processed exclusively through Apple In-App Purchase / Apple Pay; we never store your card data.

Auto-Renewal — Unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the current term ends, Apple may automatically bill the next term to your Apple ID.

Manage / Cancel — Open Settings › Apple ID › Subscriptions on your iOS device to change or cancel. Deleting the app does not stop renewal.

Refunds — Apple handles all refund requests under its App Store policies. We cannot issue refunds directly.

Price & Feature Changes — We may modify fees or features for future terms. We will notify you in advance, and you may cancel before the change takes effect.

6 | Intellectual Property
All software, trademarks, logos, text, graphics, and other content in the app are the property of HitUp Tennis or its licensors and are protected by U.S. and international laws. We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the app solely as permitted by these Terms.

7 | Privacy
Your use of the app is also governed by our separate Privacy Policy, which explains what data we collect and how we use it. By using the app, you consent to that Policy.

8 | Disclaimers
“As Is” Service — The app is provided as is and as available. We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

No Guarantee of Matches — We do not guarantee you will find partners, that matches will occur, or that information provided by users is accurate.

Third-Party Links — The app may display links or integrations with third-party services. We are not responsible for those services.

9 | Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, our total liability for any claim arising out of or relating to the services is limited to the greater of (a) USD 50 or (b) the amount you paid us (if any) for the Season Membership in the 12 months before the claim. We will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; if those laws apply to you, some or all of the above disclaimers and limitations may not apply.

10 | Indemnification
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless HitUp Tennis, its affiliates, and their officers, employees, and agents from and against any third-party claims, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to (a) your use or misuse of the services; (b) your violation of these Terms; or (c) your violation of any third-party rights.

11 | Modifications to Terms
We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be announced in-app or via email before they take effect. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. If you disagree with changes, you must stop using the app and, if applicable, cancel your Season Membership.

12 | Governing Law & Dispute Resolution
Law — These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflict-of-law rules.

Venue — Any dispute arising under these Terms shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Orange County, California, and you consent to their jurisdiction.

Time Limit — Any claim must be filed within one (1) year after the cause of action arises, or it is permanently barred.

13 | Severability
If any provision of these Terms is held unenforceable, that provision will be modified to reflect the parties’ intention or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so the remaining provisions remain in full force.

14 | Entire Agreement
These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any additional policies referenced herein, constitute the entire agreement between you and HitUp Tennis regarding the services and supersede any prior agreements.
